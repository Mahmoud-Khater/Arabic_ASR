# Django AI Project with Finetuned Model

This is a Django project that integrates finetuned AI models for [describe the purpose of your project, e.g., text classification, image recognition, etc.].

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Git

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Download the finetuned model weights:**
   - The model weights are not included in this repository due to their size.
   - Download the weights from [insert link to Google Drive, Hugging Face, or other storage].
   - Place the weights in the `models/` directory.

5. **Run migrations:**
   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

6. **Start the Django development server:**
   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` to see the application.

## Project Structure

- `manage.py`: Django's command-line utility for administrative tasks.
- `my_project/`: Main project directory containing settings and URL configurations.
- `my_app/`: Django app containing models, views, and templates.
- `ai_scripts/`: Scripts for finetuning and inference with AI models.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for the Django app.
- `static/`: Static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
- `models/`: Placeholder for AI model weights (download separately).

## Usage

1. **Run the application:**
   - After starting the server, access the app at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.
   - [Add specific instructions, e.g., "Navigate to the /predict endpoint to use the AI model for predictions."]

2. **Using the AI Model:**
   - The finetuned model is used for [describe the task, e.g., "text classification"].
   - Run inference using the script in `ai_scripts/inference.py`:
     ```
     python ai_scripts/inference.py --input [your-input]
     ```
   - [Add more details if needed, e.g., input format, expected output.]

## Finetuning the Model

- The finetuning script is located at `ai_scripts/finetune_model.py`.
- To finetune the model with your own data:
  ```
  python ai_scripts/finetune_model.py --data [path-to-your-data] --output [path-to-save-model]
  ```
- [Add any specific requirements, e.g., "Ensure your data is in CSV format with columns 'text' and 'label'."]

## Notes

- Ensure you have the required AI libraries installed (e.g., PyTorch, Transformers). These are listed in `requirements.txt`.
- If you encounter issues with the model weights, verify the file integrity and compatibility with the library versions.
- For sensitive configurations (e.g., API keys), use a `.env` file (not included in the repository). See `my_project/settings.example.py` for reference.
